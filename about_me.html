      <h1 class="section-intro-title">About Me</h1>
      <p class="section-intro-content">
        I'm Thomas Fran√ßois, a 17 years-old student at Adam-de-Craponne.<br>
        I'm mostly studying Maths and Computer Sciences in high-school.<br>
        I love all the revolves around these two subects.
      </p>
      <h1 class="section-intro-title">Programming</h1>
      <p class="section-intro-content">
        I love to program all sorts of games and apps that I can use<br>
        on a day-to-day basis, or for the sake of learning.<br>
        I only developed such keen interest in programmation<br>
        when I got in touch with Scratch when I was 12.<br>
        I then discovered Python (for more general programmation)<br>
        and C# (for games) when I was 15, I haven't stopped creating with,<br>
        and learning from these two vast languages since then.<br>
        However, I'm certainly inclined to learn about new ones.
      </p>
      <h1 class="section-intro-title">Computers</h1>
      <p class="section-intro-content">
        I got my first Windows PC when I was 14.<br>
        It's not until late 2021 that I've gotten comfortable with<br>
        using other OSs such as Linux's Ubuntu and Kali on a virtual machine.<br>
        Since then, I've been introduced to the basics of penetration testing<br>
        with websites such as HackTheBox or TryHackMe for instance.
      </p>
      <h1 class="section-intro-title">Music</h1>
      <p class="section-intro-content">
        As everyone is, I'm a huge music fan since I'm 14.<br>
        I've been playing electric guitar ever since,<br>
        and have listened to lots of different musical genres<br>
        ranging from Rock or Rap to the most "gloomy" shades of metal<br>
        thanks to the recommandations of others.<br>
        I'm also the founder of a high-school band in which<br>
        we've once played in front of the entire school.<br>
        More recently, I've been learning music theory<br>
        but haven't been able to put that to practice due<br>
        to a lack of time.
